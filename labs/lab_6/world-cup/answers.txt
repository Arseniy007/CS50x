Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
With a small number of simulations Croatia got 10% chance of winning the tournament, after 1000000 simulations we can clearly see that its chances are less than 2%.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations.
